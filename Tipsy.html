				<h3>Week 1: 1/27</h3>
				<p>This week, we all worked on preparing our project presentation. 
				This forced us to have a more clear idea on where we were going with 
				our game in order to establish clear commitments for First Playable. 
				We decided our commitments around some of the fundamental aspects of 
				the game without worrying too much about aesthetics or minor details 
				that we want in the final game: for the first playable, the user 
				should be able to interact with objects in the VR environment (namely, 
				the glass and bottle assets), be able to select which object to control 
				through a UI, have the ability to create simple drinks (i.e., shots), 
				there should be a point system based on the correctness/timeliness of 
				a completed drink, and have customer NPCs that are spawned, order drinks,
				and have a timer attached to them where the user must complete the 
				customer’s drink within the time limit in order to receive points for 
				the drink. As a group, we decided how to split up the work for the project 
				in order to meet our commitments for First Playable. John is going to 
				focus on the mechanics/controller interaction in the game because he 
				has an interest in it and he is the one that owns the Go so he will 
				have the most opportunity to tinker with it; he’ll also work on the 
				game logic (i.e., how drinks are scored). Matthew will work on the UI 
				components (the menus and other UI components of the game) and scene 
				management (both writing scripts for switching between scenes and for 
				the logic when a scene should be switched, i.e., at the end of a level) 
				because he has background experience with both of these tasks in Unity. 
				Jonathan will develop the website because he has prior experience in 
				web development and he’ll develop/find art and audio assets.</p>
				
				<h3>Week 2: 2/3</h3>
				<h3>John </h3>
				<p>This week, I worked on interfacing Unity with the Oculus Integration 
				package. Getting Unity to build for the Oculus Go involved downloading 
				and configuring the necessary packages and figuring out how to utilize 
				all the different sources of input from the headset (i.e., the rotation 
				of the headset, the rotation of the controller, and the triggers/touchpad 
				on the controller). I also created a script to do some basic object 
				interaction. This involved creating a Raycast from the tip of the 
				controller that, when the Raycast hits an object tagged “interactable”, 
				the user can press the trigger to pick up the object and have the object’s 
				position tied to the movement of the controller. Since the position of the 
				controller is not tracked (there are no sensors that come with the Oculus 
				Go; the only tracking for both the headset and controller is rotational), 
				this involved moving the controller towards the direction of the change in 
				rotation of the controller. For example, if the controller is rotated up, 
				the object is moved upwards in space. </p>

				<h3>Week 3: 2/10</h3>
				<p>This week, we decided on an asset pack to purchase for our objects/environment. We ended up going with a pack called 9t5 Low Poly Pub Pack. A screenshot of the demo scene that came with the pack is shown above. We decided to go with this pack for a few reasons. First, we were looking for a low-poly asset pack because we were afraid of what high-poly assets would do to our frame rate since our game is in VR. Second, we saw many bar packs, but not many that were both low-poly and contained all the assets we needed (both the bar scene and the glasses/bottles for drink pouring). Third, the pack is cheap; it only costs $5.</p>
				<h3>John </h3>
				<p>This week, I worked on improving the mechanics of our object interaction and getting object interaction working with the objects in the asset pack we purchased. I added rotation to the objects that were picked up to serve as the basis for pouring. I ended up disabling rotation when interacting with cups because it was making it difficult to set the cup down on the table properly when the cup was allowed to rotate. This is a tough decision because we want the game to feel as immersive as possible and like you’re actually picking up objects and pouring drinks, but it seems worth it for making the game play smoother. One challenge with getting object interaction working with the imported assets was that, since the objects were created in a 3D modelling application, the imported assets had a different default direction than Unity assets (the objects had their y and z axes switched when imported into Unity). This caused problems with our object interaction code because when one of these imported objects was picked up, the rotation of the object was sideways when it should have been standing straight. Through some searching, I found out this is a pretty common problem people run into when importing assets into Unity. The solution (which can be found here: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/HOWTO-FixZAxisIsUp.html) is to create an empty GameObject with the correct transform, and make the imported object a child of the empty GameObject. </p>

				<h3>Week 4: 2/17</h3>
				<h3>John </h3>
				<p>This week, I worked on the mechanics of drink serving and added customer spawning. To serve drinks, I wrote a script that involved adding a Raycaster to the cup object that points directly down and checking whether it hits a bar seat. If it does and the user releases the cup, then the cup is slowly lowered to the bar mat in front of the customer (this is done using the MoveTowards() method to move the cup at a set speed until it reaches its destination), and the drink is “served”: the customer has a reference to the cup so that it can calculate the score for the drink (score calculation still needs to be added), then the both the customer and cup objects are destroyed in order to free up the seat for a new customer. Customers are randomly spawned at bar seats in randomly-generated intervals. The underlying logic behind this is that, although the bar seating looks continuous, it’s actually broken up into 6 distinct bar seats. Each of these bar seats can have an attached customer. When a new customer is to be spawned, the customer is assigned to a randomly-chosen empty seat (if there is one currently available; if all the seats are taken, then we wait until one frees up); each bar seat has a preset “customer location” transform where the customer should be placed. Then, when a cup is released over a specific bar seat, the script attached to the cup asks for the location to place the cup for that specific bar seat (this is preset just like the customer location), then the cup gradually moves towards that position. Once the cup reaches that position, the customer waits for a few seconds (this is when the score for the drink would be displayed), then the cup and customer objects are destroyed.</p>

				<p>Fixed a bug that prevented updates to the webpage to be stored on github's server</p>
				
				<h3>Week 5: 2/24</h3>
				<h3>John </h3>
				<p>This week, I worked mostly on game logic for the first level. I added a Drink struct that allows us to add drinks via the inspector. This will make it easier in the future to add new drinks to levels: we simply fill in some fields in the inspector and, without any further work, that drink will be added to the level. Other than that, I worked on the customer ordering and serving aspects. For customer ordering, I worked with Matthew to develop a UI that goes above the customer’s head that displays the name, contents, and timer for their order (if the timer expires before the customer is served, the customer object is destroyed and no points are given for that order). For customer serving, I added a static DataManager script that keeps track of the overall score for the player (along with text above the object selection UI showing the player’s current score). When a customer is served, the score for the drink is calculated and added to the overall score for the player.</p>
				<h3>Matthew</h3>
				<h3>Jonathan</h3>
				<p>Developed the pouring mechanics. A particle system should arch from a point. On collision with a bottle, the bottle should spawn spheres that represent the liquid in the drink. </p>
				
				<h3>Week 6: 3/3</h3>
				<h3>John </h3>
				<p>This week, I finalized some of the game logic for the demo and worked with Jonathan to integrate the pouring system he had been working on with our game. We ran into some challenges with the physics of the cup (when the cup had a RigidBody attached to it, the filling mechanism didn’t work), so we worked around that by removing the RigidBody from the cup and putting in some custom physics. Once we had the pouring integrated, I worked on the scoring calculation for drinks. For now, the scoring system is as follows: 10 * (1 - percent_error) * (1 + fraction_time_left), where percent_error is the percent difference between the contents of the drink and the drink order, fraction_time_left is the fraction of time on the customer timer left when the player served the drink, and 10 is just a number I picked that made the scores come out nice (this is configurable via the inspector so that it can be changed as needed). Players who serve a drink that contains a liquid that isn’t supposed to be in the drink (i.e., serving rum in a tequila shot) automatically receive a score of zero for that drink. This calculation isn’t set in stone and is just a proof of concept that we can factor in accuracy of the drink and time to make the drink into the scoring calculation. We’re planning to revisit the scoring calculation in the future once we have more users test the game and give us feedback on the scoring.</p>

				<p> Attached the pouring mechanism to the liquor bottle. Assembled slides on the pouring mechanism for the first playable presentation.</p>
				
				<h3>Week 7: 3/10</h3>
				<p>This week was spring break and we had just completed our goals for the First Playable presentation, so we took this as a time to step away from development for a week and do some research for future features. John researched character assets for the customers and how we can use their built-in animations in Unity, Matthew researched graphical raycasting to improve the UI of the game, and Jonathan researched shaders as a replacement for the spheres in the cups. </p>
				
				<h3>Week 8: 3/17</h3>
				<h3>John </h3>
				<p>This week, I worked mostly integrating the customer assets into our game. The asset pack we decided on is called “Low Poly Business People”. We chose it because it is low-poly and we didn’t want to hurt our game’s frame rate by introducing graphics-intensive characters, and this pack offered built-in animations at a cheap price. I worked on swapping out our placeholder characters with these characters (i.e., adding the billboard of the customer’s order above their head) and started working with the animations. Our goal for testing day is to have the customers walk from outside the bar to their seat, so we’ll need to integrate the walking and sitting animations. I started to play around with possible animation sequences and researched how to synchronize movement speed with animation speed and how to implement NPC navigation in Unity.</p>
				<h3>Matthew</h3>
				<h3>Jonathan</h3>
				
				<h3>Week 8: 3/24</h3>
				<h3>John </h3>
				<p>This week, I focused on customer animations and navigation. For navigation, I placed a Navmesh on the scene, and added a Navmesh Agent component to the customers to enable navigation. Their destinations are set dynamically when the customer is spawned; a random empty seat at the bar is chosen, then the destination for the Navmesh Agent is set to the location of that seat. This solved the movement aspect of the customers, but I needed the animations to synchronize with this as well. I used the built-in animations provided by the asset pack and created a custom Animation Controller for playing the customer’s animations. The conditions for transitions are set in our scripts for the game so that we have tight control over when the animations are played and what triggers them. Upon customer spawning, the walking animation is started and the Navmesh Agent destination is set to the seat that the customer is assigned to. When a customer arrives at the seat (which has a box collider to detect when this happens), a flag is set to tell the Animation Controller to start the sitting animation. When a customer is served or their timer runs out, a flag is set to tell the Animation Controller to start the standing/walking animation and the destination for the Navmesh Agent is set to a location outside the bar.</p>

				<h3>Week 8: 3/31</h3>
				<h3>John </h3>
				<p>This week, I worked on adding support for beer tap pouring and selecting/serving bottled beers. The beer tap is an asset that came with the pub pack that we had purchased; however, it was purely decorational in the pack. To implement the functionality of the beer tap, I added capsule colliders to each of the levers to detect when players were hovering over them and I added a particle system (the same one that’s used for the bottles) below each of the nozzles. For the bottled beers, Jonathan created the animations for the fridge doors opening and closing, and I added a script that places a bottle of the type of beer that’s in the fridge in the player’s control whenever a player clicks on an opened fridge. I then added the logic to the customers for giving points for correctly served bottled beers since it differs from normal drinks in that the player is not pouring anything; the customer only needs to check that the type of bottled beer is correct (by checking the tag of the bottle’s GameObject) and then points are given based on how quickly it was served. For both the beer tap and fridges, I added labels for the type of beer that appear when you hover over a tap lever or fridge.</p>
