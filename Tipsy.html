				<h3>Week 1: 1/27</h3>
				<p>This week, we all worked on preparing our project presentation. 
				This forced us to have a more clear idea on where we were going with 
				our game in order to establish clear commitments for First Playable. 
				We decided our commitments around some of the fundamental aspects of 
				the game without worrying too much about aesthetics or minor details 
				that we want in the final game: for the first playable, the user 
				should be able to interact with objects in the VR environment (namely, 
				the glass and bottle assets), be able to select which object to control 
				through a UI, have the ability to create simple drinks (i.e., shots), 
				there should be a point system based on the correctness/timeliness of 
				a completed drink, and have customer NPCs that are spawned, order drinks,
				and have a timer attached to them where the user must complete the 
				customer’s drink within the time limit in order to receive points for 
				the drink. As a group, we decided how to split up the work for the project 
				in order to meet our commitments for First Playable. John is going to 
				focus on the mechanics/controller interaction in the game because he 
				has an interest in it and he is the one that owns the Go so he will 
				have the most opportunity to tinker with it; he’ll also work on the 
				game logic (i.e., how drinks are scored). Matthew will work on the UI 
				components (the menus and other UI components of the game) and scene 
				management (both writing scripts for switching between scenes and for 
				the logic when a scene should be switched, i.e., at the end of a level) 
				because he has background experience with both of these tasks in Unity. 
				Jonathan will develop the website because he has prior experience in 
				web development and he’ll develop/find art and audio assets.</p>
				
				<h3>Week 2: 2/3</h3>
				<h3>John </h3>
				<p>This week, I worked on interfacing Unity with the Oculus Integration 
				package. Getting Unity to build for the Oculus Go involved downloading 
				and configuring the necessary packages and figuring out how to utilize 
				all the different sources of input from the headset (i.e., the rotation 
				of the headset, the rotation of the controller, and the triggers/touchpad 
				on the controller). I also created a script to do some basic object 
				interaction. This involved creating a Raycast from the tip of the 
				controller that, when the Raycast hits an object tagged “interactable”, 
				the user can press the trigger to pick up the object and have the object’s 
				position tied to the movement of the controller. Since the position of the 
				controller is not tracked (there are no sensors that come with the Oculus 
				Go; the only tracking for both the headset and controller is rotational), 
				this involved moving the controller towards the direction of the change in 
				rotation of the controller. For example, if the controller is rotated up, 
				the object is moved upwards in space. </p>
				<h3>Matthew</h3>
				<p>This week I worked on the initial drafts for the User Interfaces. Specifically I worked on what the Main Menu and how the ingredients for the cocktail making process would be laid out through a User Interface. Specifically the design I will be trying to make will be easily accessible and won’t take up too much space on the screen, since clarity and freedom of movement are key to VR games.</p>

				<h3>Week 3: 2/10</h3>
				<p>This week, we decided on an asset pack to purchase for our objects/environment. We ended up going with a pack called 9t5 Low Poly Pub Pack. A screenshot of the demo scene that came with the pack is shown above. We decided to go with this pack for a few reasons. First, we were looking for a low-poly asset pack because we were afraid of what high-poly assets would do to our frame rate since our game is in VR. Second, we saw many bar packs, but not many that were both low-poly and contained all the assets we needed (both the bar scene and the glasses/bottles for drink pouring). Third, the pack is cheap; it only costs $5.</p>
				<h3>John </h3>
				<p>This week, I worked on improving the mechanics of our object interaction and getting object interaction working with the objects in the asset pack we purchased. I added rotation to the objects that were picked up to serve as the basis for pouring. I ended up disabling rotation when interacting with cups because it was making it difficult to set the cup down on the table properly when the cup was allowed to rotate. This is a tough decision because we want the game to feel as immersive as possible and like you’re actually picking up objects and pouring drinks, but it seems worth it for making the game play smoother. One challenge with getting object interaction working with the imported assets was that, since the objects were created in a 3D modelling application, the imported assets had a different default direction than Unity assets (the objects had their y and z axes switched when imported into Unity). This caused problems with our object interaction code because when one of these imported objects was picked up, the rotation of the object was sideways when it should have been standing straight. Through some searching, I found out this is a pretty common problem people run into when importing assets into Unity. The solution (which can be found here: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/HOWTO-FixZAxisIsUp.html) is to create an empty GameObject with the correct transform, and make the imported object a child of the empty GameObject. </p>
				<h3>Matthew</h3>
				<p>For this week I focused on the Main Menu layout and construction. I also worked on the construction for the Drink and Cocktail creation UI. This included making the UI perform as a dropdown to make the Cocktail construction UI more compact and user friendly.</p>
				<h3>Jonathan</h3>
				<p>Researched pouring mechanism</p>
				
				<h3>Week 4: 2/17</h3>
				<h3>John </h3>
				<p>This week, I worked on the mechanics of drink serving and added customer spawning. To serve drinks, I wrote a script that involved adding a Raycaster to the cup object that points directly down and checking whether it hits a bar seat. If it does and the user releases the cup, then the cup is slowly lowered to the bar mat in front of the customer (this is done using the MoveTowards() method to move the cup at a set speed until it reaches its destination), and the drink is “served”: the customer has a reference to the cup so that it can calculate the score for the drink (score calculation still needs to be added), then the both the customer and cup objects are destroyed in order to free up the seat for a new customer. Customers are randomly spawned at bar seats in randomly-generated intervals. The underlying logic behind this is that, although the bar seating looks continuous, it’s actually broken up into 6 distinct bar seats. Each of these bar seats can have an attached customer. When a new customer is to be spawned, the customer is assigned to a randomly-chosen empty seat (if there is one currently available; if all the seats are taken, then we wait until one frees up); each bar seat has a preset “customer location” transform where the customer should be placed. Then, when a cup is released over a specific bar seat, the script attached to the cup asks for the location to place the cup for that specific bar seat (this is preset just like the customer location), then the cup gradually moves towards that position. Once the cup reaches that position, the customer waits for a few seconds (this is when the score for the drink would be displayed), then the cup and customer objects are destroyed.</p>
				<h3>Matthew</h3>
				<p>This week i focused on trying to make the UI in the game solely from the Canvas UI elements instead of the Physical based UI that has been the main type of UI that we have been using as of now. I also worked on the the UI for the end of level Scene and the Level Selection Scene. On top of this I added an extra button on the Main Menu that will send the player to the Level Selection Scene</p>
				<h3>Jonathan</h3>
				<p>Fixed a bug that prevented updates to the webpage to be stored on github's server</p>
				
				<h3>Week 5: 2/24</h3>
				<h3>John </h3>
				<p>This week, I worked mostly on game logic for the first level. I added a Drink struct that allows us to add drinks via the inspector. This will make it easier in the future to add new drinks to levels: we simply fill in some fields in the inspector and, without any further work, that drink will be added to the level. Other than that, I worked on the customer ordering and serving aspects. For customer ordering, I worked with Matthew to develop a UI that goes above the customer’s head that displays the name, contents, and timer for their order (if the timer expires before the customer is served, the customer object is destroyed and no points are given for that order). For customer serving, I added a static DataManager script that keeps track of the overall score for the player (along with text above the object selection UI showing the player’s current score). When a customer is served, the score for the drink is calculated and added to the overall score for the player.</p>
				<h3>Matthew</h3>
				<p>For this week, I continued to try to make the UI more based off the insoftware Unity based UI. Complications are coming up trying to use this UI because in VR the required raycasting to UI elements are not physical raycasts. In order to get the Raycasting to work, further research must be done to find out how to have the Oculus Go headset allow Raycasting to be functional with the built in Unity UI. </p>
				<h3>Jonathan</h3>
				<p>Developed the pouring mechanics. A particle system should arch from a point. On collision with a bottle, the bottle should spawn spheres that represent the liquid in the drink. </p>
				
				<h3>Week 6: 3/3</h3>
				<h3>John </h3>
				<p>This week, I finalized some of the game logic for the demo and worked with Jonathan to integrate the pouring system he had been working on with our game. We ran into some challenges with the physics of the cup (when the cup had a RigidBody attached to it, the filling mechanism didn’t work), so we worked around that by removing the RigidBody from the cup and putting in some custom physics. Once we had the pouring integrated, I worked on the scoring calculation for drinks. For now, the scoring system is as follows: 10 * (1 - percent_error) * (1 + fraction_time_left), where percent_error is the percent difference between the contents of the drink and the drink order, fraction_time_left is the fraction of time on the customer timer left when the player served the drink, and 10 is just a number I picked that made the scores come out nice (this is configurable via the inspector so that it can be changed as needed). Players who serve a drink that contains a liquid that isn’t supposed to be in the drink (i.e., serving rum in a tequila shot) automatically receive a score of zero for that drink. This calculation isn’t set in stone and is just a proof of concept that we can factor in accuracy of the drink and time to make the drink into the scoring calculation. We’re planning to revisit the scoring calculation in the future once we have more users test the game and give us feedback on the scoring.</p>
				<h3>Matthew</h3>
				<p>This week I continued to work on the UI and find out how to again use the Unity built in UI’s. Through the research I have found that most or all of the required software that is used to convert raycasting from the controllers to affect the in-game UI’s. This has proved unsuccessful so far. I have continued to make two versions of most of the UI, one in the 3D object from that currently works, and world space Unity based UI. The Unity based UI looks cleaner, but the 3D based UI works and still works for the purposes of the game.</p>
				<h3>Jonathan</h3>
				<p> Attached the pouring mechanism to the liquor bottle. Assembled slides on the pouring mechanism for the first playable presentation.</p>
				
				<h3>Week 7: 3/10</h3>
				<p>This week was spring break and we had just completed our goals for the First Playable presentation, so we took this as a time to step away from development for a week and do some research for future features. John researched character assets for the customers and how we can use their built-in animations in Unity, Matthew researched graphical raycasting to improve the UI of the game, and Jonathan researched shaders as a replacement for the spheres in the cups. </p>
				
				<h3>Week 8: 3/17</h3>
				<h3>John </h3>
				<p>This week, I worked mostly integrating the customer assets into our game. The asset pack we decided on is called “Low Poly Business People”. We chose it because it is low-poly and we didn’t want to hurt our game’s frame rate by introducing graphics-intensive characters, and this pack offered built-in animations at a cheap price. I worked on swapping out our placeholder characters with these characters (i.e., adding the billboard of the customer’s order above their head) and started working with the animations. Our goal for testing day is to have the customers walk from outside the bar to their seat, so we’ll need to integrate the walking and sitting animations. I started to play around with possible animation sequences and researched how to synchronize movement speed with animation speed and how to implement NPC navigation in Unity.</p>
				<h3>Matthew</h3>
				<p>For this week I am making a new type of UI for the Pour Meter. Originally we used a text meter that just showed the amount of liquid that was in the current container, but only showed the text of it. What I worked on this week was a physical meter that shows the current amount of liquid in the container and also shows a red line that is where the player should aim for as a final amount poured.</p>
				<h3>Jonathan</h3>
				
				<h3>Week 8: 3/24</h3>
				<h3>John </h3>
				<p>This week, I focused on customer animations and navigation. For navigation, I placed a Navmesh on the scene, and added a Navmesh Agent component to the customers to enable navigation. Their destinations are set dynamically when the customer is spawned; a random empty seat at the bar is chosen, then the destination for the Navmesh Agent is set to the location of that seat. This solved the movement aspect of the customers, but I needed the animations to synchronize with this as well. I used the built-in animations provided by the asset pack and created a custom Animation Controller for playing the customer’s animations. The conditions for transitions are set in our scripts for the game so that we have tight control over when the animations are played and what triggers them. Upon customer spawning, the walking animation is started and the Navmesh Agent destination is set to the seat that the customer is assigned to. When a customer arrives at the seat (which has a box collider to detect when this happens), a flag is set to tell the Animation Controller to start the sitting animation. When a customer is served or their timer runs out, a flag is set to tell the Animation Controller to start the standing/walking animation and the destination for the Navmesh Agent is set to a location outside the bar.</p>
				<h3>Matthew</h3>
				<p>This week I focused my efforts to finishing up the fill meter UI and also did more research on how the Oculus Go understands World Space UI. I found some more information pertaining to the Input Module that the Oculus Go uses, and also how it interprets raycasts with UI. After many trials and errors we found that the Oculus can interact with built in Unity UIs. But the issue is that the raycast does not come from the Oculus remote, but instead from the top front of the Oculus Go headset. This is an issue because we want the controller to be the base of all interactions with interactable objects from the controller. </p>
				<h3>Jonathan</h3>
				
				<h3>Week 8: 3/31</h3>
				<h3>John </h3>
				<p>This week, I worked on adding support for beer tap pouring and selecting/serving bottled beers. The beer tap is an asset that came with the pub pack that we had purchased; however, it was purely decorational in the pack. To implement the functionality of the beer tap, I added capsule colliders to each of the levers to detect when players were hovering over them and I added a particle system (the same one that’s used for the bottles) below each of the nozzles. For the bottled beers, Jonathan created the animations for the fridge doors opening and closing, and I added a script that places a bottle of the type of beer that’s in the fridge in the player’s control whenever a player clicks on an opened fridge. I then added the logic to the customers for giving points for correctly served bottled beers since it differs from normal drinks in that the player is not pouring anything; the customer only needs to check that the type of bottled beer is correct (by checking the tag of the bottle’s GameObject) and then points are given based on how quickly it was served. For both the beer tap and fridges, I added labels for the type of beer that appear when you hover over a tap lever or fridge.</p>
				<h3>Matthew</h3>
				<p>This week I focused on making the more UI for Tipsy. Mostly making a pause menu UI that can be called whenever a button is pressed on the remote. This proves useful in the game because if the player needs to take a break or needs to pause the game for any reason, we can give the player a quick and easy way of doing that. The contents of the Pause Menu UI will have the current score of the player, a resume button that will continue the game right when the player originally paused it. It will also have a Main Menu button that will bring the player back to the Main Menu if they want to stop playing the game for any reason.</p>
				<h3>Jonathan</h3>
				
				<h3>Week 8: 4/7</h3>
				<h3>John </h3>
				<p>This week, I mainly worked on a feature to allow players to control the depth of objects by scrolling on the touchpad of the Oculus Go controller. The raw data for the touchpad is easily accessible, but I’ve been doing research on how we could take this input and use it for adjusting object depth and seeing how this would integrate with the bounding box mechanism we already have for controlling object depth.</p>
				<h3>Matthew</h3>
				<p>For this week I worked primarily on the making the new UI’s that were requested after our Testing Day. After the testing day, we found that a tutorial of sorts was necessary to help first time players, to get used to the game before actually playing it. What I specifically worked on this week was some of the panels that would display text. This text would provide helpful hints to guild the player, and help them get used to the mechanics of the game.</p>
				<h3>Jonathan</h3>
				
				<h3>Week 8: 4/14</h3>
				<h3>John </h3>
				<p>This week, I continued to work on the feature to allow players to adjust the depth of objects via scrolling on the touchpad, but my main focus was on preparing my portion of the AI presentation and report. Mainly, I focused on the customer-related AI I’ve been working on throughout the semester. This included how the navigation and animations of the customers are tied together, how drinks are served to customers, and how customers score drinks. </p>
				<h3>Matthew</h3>
				<p>For this week, I continued to work on the tutorial panels of text that would be used to assist new players for the game. I worked collaboratively with my team members to find out the optimal amount of panels. I did not want too many that would clutter up the level and take up too much space. But I also did not what to have too little, as to not help the players enough.</p>
				<h3>Jonathan</h3>
				
				<h3>Week 8: 4/21</h3>
				<h3>John </h3>
				<p>To prepare for the final demo of the game, I’ve been working on finishing up what we decided we need to add/change since testing day. This included adding some new features like pausing during a level and integrating a music-playing jukebox asset that Jonathan made. I also worked on tweaking data-driven variables such as the spawn times of customers, the scrolling rate for adjusting the depth of objects, and the pour rate of drinks based on both testing day feedback as well as more recent playtesting we did.</p>
				<h3>Matthew</h3>
				<p>For the final week, we are all pushing our final updates to the game. This included finding the small bugs that we noticed along the way. Some of the bugs include Nav mesh collisions that needed to be resolved. Some of the timing with the sound queues, and also some of the levels weren’t building properly. After fixing the bugs, we polished off the last update that we will push to the game. </p>
